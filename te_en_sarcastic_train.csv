"Although modern humans are from the modern era, the virus found in them has been continuously changing for generations since 500,000 years. This has been revealed in a study conducted by researchers. Researchers say that the viruses that plagued Neanderthal mankind 500,000 years ago are also found in modern people today. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth University have recently compared the DNA of modern humans with the ancestral remains of Neanderthal and Denisovans. Researchers say that endogenous retroviruses make up eight percent of the genetic DNA in this study. Scientists have found a link between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) of the ancestral HML2 family and the cancer-causing and HIV-causing viruses that are currently afflicting mankind. Researchers say that when these hereditary viruses are combined with other HIV viruses, the DNA of modern humans is also compared. The researchers say that these are due to the presence of endogenous retroviruses, which are less resistant to cancer. Researchers say that these viruses are also less susceptible to diseases such as HIV / AIDS.","Man is modern, but the virus is ancient"
